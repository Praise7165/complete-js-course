CODING CHALLENGE #4
Steven wants to build a very simple tip calculator for whenever he goes eating in a restaurant. In his country, it's usual to tip 15% if the bill value is between 50 and 300. If the value is different, the tip is 20%.


Your tasks:
1. Calculate the tip, depending on the bill value. Create a variable called 'tip' for this. It's not allowed to use an if/else statement (If it's easier for you, you can start with an if/else statement, and then try to convert it to a ternary operator!)

2. Print a string to the console containing the bill value, the tip, and the final value (bill + tip). Example: âThe bill was 275, the tip was 41.25, and the total value 316.25â


Test data:
Â§ Data 1: Test for bill values 275, 40 and 430

Hints:
Â§ To calculate 20% of a value, simply multiply it by 20/100 = 0.2
Â§ Value X is between 50 and 300, if it's >= 50 && <= 300
